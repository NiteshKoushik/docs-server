== Managing Auto-Compaction: Globally

[abstract]
Auto-compaction settings can be established and retrieved for the entire cluster; meaning that all new buckets inherit the settings, and maintain them until individually changed.

== Description

The _global_ auto-compaction settings are the default settings used for each newly created bucket.
When changes are made to the global settings, these changes will apply to all new buckets.
They also apply immediately to all existing buckets whose own settings continue to be the defaults: however, once a bucket's settings are directly modified, they will no longer be affected by changes to the global settings.

== HTTP methods and URIs

Global auto-compaction settings are retrieved and established by the following combinations of http method and URI:

----
GET /settings/autoCompaction

POST /controller/setAutoCompaction
----

== Curl Syntax

curl -u [admin-name]:[password] -X GET
  http://[cluster-ip-address]:8091/settings/autoCompaction

The parameters, which can be specified to the `POST` method and retrieved by the `GET` method, are as follows:

[cols="20,20"]
|===
| Function | Description

| `autoCompactionDefined`
| Boolean specifying whether the auto-compaction settings for the specified bucket can be modified.
If `true`, the settings _can_ be modified.
If `false`, they _cannot_ be modified.

| `databaseFragmentationThreshold[percentage]`
| Integer specifying the database fragmentation percentage that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `databaseFragmentationThreshold[size]`
| Integer specifying the megabytes of database fragmentation that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `viewFragmentationThreshold[percentage]`
| Integer specifying the view fragmentation percentage that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `viewFragmentationThreshold[size]`
| Integer specifying the megabytes of view fragmentation that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `allowedTimePeriod[fromHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the starting hour of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[fromMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the starting minute (within the specified starting hour) of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[toHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the concluding hour of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[toMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the concluding minute (within the specified concluding hour) of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[abortOutside]`
| Either `true` or `false`, indicating respectively that compaction _should_ or _should not_ be aborted, if its running extends beyond the specified time of conclusion.

| `parallelDBAndViewCompaction`
| Either `true` or `false`, indicating respectively that compaction of databases and views _should_ or _should not_ run in parallel.

| `purgeInterval`
| The frequency with which the _tombstone purge_ is run, specified as either an integer or a decimal number.
If a decimal is specified, the fractional part is rounded at fifteen places.
The default value is 3.0; the minimum 0.04; the maximum 60.

| `indexCompactionMode`
| The compaction mode for indexes.
Can be either `standard` or `circular`.

| `indexCircularCompaction[daysOfWeek]`
| The days of the week on which circular compaction (if specified) is to run.
Individual values must be day-names, each specified with an initial capital, and otherwise lower-case: `Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`.
Multiple values must be separated by a single comma, with no spaces.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][fromHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the starting hour of the time-period during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][fromMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the starting minute of the time-period, within the specified starting hour, during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][toHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the concluding hour of the time-period during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][toMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the concluding minute of the time-period, within the specified concluding hour, during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][abortOutside]`
| Either `true` or `false`, indicating respectively that circular index compaction, if specified, _should_ or _should not_ be aborted, if its running extends beyond the specified time of conclusion.

== Examples

The following examples show how to retrieve and establish auto-compaction settings, globally.

=== Retrieving Global Auto-Compaction Settings

The following command retrieves the global auto-compaction settings.
Note that the output is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] command, to optimize readability.

----
curl -i -X GET http://10.143.193.101:8091/settings/autoCompaction \
-u Administrator:password  | jq
----

If successful, the command returns output similar to the following:

----
{
  "autoCompactionSettings": {
    "parallelDBAndViewCompaction": false,
    "allowedTimePeriod": {
      "fromHour": 1,
      "toHour": 2,
      "fromMinute": 30,
      "toMinute": 30,
      "abortOutside": true
    },
    "databaseFragmentationThreshold": {
      "percentage": 50,
      "size": 52428800
    },
    "viewFragmentationThreshold": {
      "percentage": 70,
      "size": 52428800
    },
    "indexCompactionMode": "circular",
    "indexCircularCompaction": {
      "daysOfWeek": "Sunday,Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday,Saturday",
      "interval": {
        "fromHour": 0,
        "toHour": 0,
        "fromMinute": 0,
        "toMinute": 0,
        "abortOutside": false
      }
    },
    "indexFragmentationThreshold": {
      "percentage": 30
    }
  },
  "purgeInterval": 30
}

=== Establishing Global Auto-Compaction Settings

The following command provides values for all the global auto-compaction parameters.

----
curl -i -X POST http://10.143.192.101:8091/controller/setAutoCompaction \
-u Administrator:password \
-d databaseFragmentationThreshold[percentage]=30 \

This example establishes fragmentation thresholds and sizes for database and view, and specifies the time-period during which compaction should occur.
It specifies that compaction be aborted if it should overrun this time-period.
Parallel compaction for database and view is switched _off_.
The tombstone purge interval is set to 3 days; and _circular_ standard compaction is specified for particular days and hours.
